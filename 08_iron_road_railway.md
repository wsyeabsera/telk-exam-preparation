### The Iron Road: Building the Djibouti–Addis Ababa Railway

**Time Period / Setting:** 1897–1917, along the route of the Franco-Ethiopian railway from the coast toward the Ethiopian highlands. The line is being pushed through desert, escarpment, and malarial lowlands. Labourers—Ethiopian, Yemeni, Somali, and others—dig, blast, and lay track. Dynamite echoes in the gorges; fever fells men by the dozen. The *ferenj* (foreign) engineers drive the work; the *capo* (foreman) and his crew bear the cost. The promise is a train that will reach *Addis Ababa* (New Flower)—the capital—and change the country. The price is paid in blood and bone.

**Characters:** Desta—Ethiopian labourer who rises to *capo* (foreman) of a blasting crew; a French or Swiss engineer who pushes the schedule; fellow workers—Yemeni, Oromo, Amhara; the *negus* (Menelik II) and the *concession* (offstage); the first locomotive that will one day whistle in the highlands.

The blast tore the morning. Desta felt it in his teeth—a deep *thump* that shook the cliff and sent a rain of pebbles down the slope. He had lit the fuse himself. He had run back along the marked path, his heart hammering, and thrown himself behind the rock. Now the dust was rising. The engineer—*Monsieur* Laurent—was shouting in French. The *ferenj* did not speak Amharic, but Desta had learned the meaning of his gestures: *faster*, *again*, *more*. The cliff had to go. The railway had to pass. Menelik had signed the *concession* (agreement). The iron road would connect the sea to the capital. It would take years. It would take lives. Desta had stopped counting the dead.

He had come from the highlands five years before. He had been a farmer. The *rinderpest* had killed his cattle; the famine had taken his youngest child. He had walked to the coast looking for work. The *ferenj* were hiring. They paid in *thalers* and in food. They did not pay enough for the risk. Every month someone was crushed by a falling rock, or caught in a slide, or bitten by a snake in the camp. Every month someone else fell ill—the *weba* (fever), the shaking sickness. The *ferenj* called it malaria. They had quinine for themselves. For the labourers they had prayers and shallow graves.

Desta had survived. He had learned to read the rock—where to drill, how much powder to use. He had learned to shout in the *ferenj*’s language when the charge was lit. He had become *capo*: the one who led the crew, who took the engineer’s orders and turned them into work. The crew trusted him. They were Yemenis who had come from Aden, Oromo from the south, Amhara from the north. They did not share a tongue. They shared the pick and the drill and the fear. At night they sat around the fire and ate *injera* and *wat* (stew) when there was any. They did not speak of home. They spoke of the rail. *When the train comes*, one of them said, *everything will change.* Desta did not know if that was true. He only knew that the train would not come until the mountain was gone. So they kept blasting.

The worst stretch was the *Awash* valley. The river was brown and slow. The air was thick with insects. The fever was everywhere. Desta watched strong men fall in a day—shivering, burning, gone. The *ferenj* moved the camp higher when they could. They did not stop the line. One morning Desta’s friend *Hassan*—a Yemeni who had taught him a few words of Arabic—did not wake. They buried him at the edge of the camp. The engineer said, *On continue.* They continued. Desta held the fuse. He ran. He hid. The blast came. The mountain gave way. The rail inched forward.

The day the first locomotive reached the escarpment—years later, in another season—Desta was there. He had not left the work. He had become a face the *ferenj* knew. They had given him a cap. He stood with the crew as the engine came around the bend. It was black and huge. It whistled. The sound echoed in the gorge. The men cheered. Some of them wept. Desta did not cheer. He thought of Hassan. He thought of the others—the names he had forgotten, the graves along the line. *The train has come*, he thought. *We built it. They will not write our names. But we built it.* He took off his cap. He held it against his chest. The whistle blew again. The iron road was open. The cost was paid. He did not know if it was worth it. He only knew that he had survived to see it.

**Historical Note:** The railway from Djibouti (then French Somaliland) to Addis Ababa was built under a concession granted by Emperor Menelik II to a French company. Construction began in the late 1890s and faced enormous challenges: desert, escarpments, the Awash valley, disease (malaria, dysentery), and the logistical difficulty of moving men and materials. Labour was drawn from Ethiopia, Yemen, and elsewhere; conditions were harsh and fatalities high. The line reached Dire Dawa in 1902 and Addis Ababa in 1917—a critical infrastructure that linked the capital to the sea and reshaped trade and politics. The human cost of the construction—the labourers, the blasting accidents, the fever—is less often told than the political and economic outcome. The story is grounded in the real history of the line’s construction, the role of foreign engineers and local labour, and the mixed legacy of “modernisation”: the train as progress and the train as something built on the backs of unnamed workers who did not live to see the first whistle in the highlands.
