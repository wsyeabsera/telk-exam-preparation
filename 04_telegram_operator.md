### The Telegram Operator

**Time Period / Setting:** Late February 1896, Addis Ababa and the telegraph line running toward the north. Emperor Menelik II has mobilised a vast army; the *Italians* have occupied Tigray and declared a protectorate. War is coming. The telegraph is new—a thread of wire and Morse code connecting the Ethiopian court to the coast and, through submarine cables, to Rome. The Italians assume the line is theirs. They have not counted on the man who sits in the small wooden hut by the *gibbi* (palace compound), listening.

**Characters:** Tesfaye—Ethiopian telegraph operator, trained by Italian technicians but loyal to Menelik; a trusted *fitawrari* (commander) who carries messages to the emperor; Italian officers and operators at the other end of the line; Emperor Menelik II (offstage but decisive); Ras Makonnen (Menelik’s general, also offstage).

The key chattered at 3 a.m. Tesfaye’s hand moved without thought—*dash-dot*, *dot-dot-dot*, the Italian operator at Massawa sending in clear. No cipher. They thought no one was listening. Or they thought the only listener was a *native* who could not read their language. Tesfaye wrote the letters in his head as they came. *R*. *E*. *I*. *N*. *F*. *O*. *R*. *C*. *E*. *M*. *E*. *N*. *T*. *S*. *D*. *E*. *L*. *A*. *Y*. *E*. *D*. *T*. *E*. *N*. *D*. *A*. *Y*. *S*. *M*. *I*. *N*. *I*. *M*. *U*. *M*.

Reinforcements delayed. Ten days minimum.

He did not move. He let the key fall silent. Then he wrote the message in Amharic on a scrap of paper, folded it, and slipped it into his *shamma*. The *fitawrari* Gebre would be at the palace gate at first light. Tesfaye would hand him the paper. The paper would reach the *negus* (king). Menelik would know that the Italian army at Adwa was weaker than it claimed—that the reinforcements from the coast would not arrive in time. The *negus* would decide what to do with that knowledge.

Tesfaye had been trained by the Italians. They had needed someone who could maintain the line, send the weather reports, relay the official traffic between the consul and Rome. They had taught him Morse. They had taught him a little Italian. They had not taught him to forget that he was Ethiopian. When Menelik’s agents had come to him—*we need to know what they say*—he had not hesitated. Every night he listened. Every morning he passed what he had learned to Gebre. Sometimes it was nothing. Sometimes it was gold.

He thought of the first message he had intercepted. Italian units quarrelling over supplies. A general complaining that the *askari* (colonial troops) were deserting. That message had made Menelik smile, the *fitawrari* had said. The *negus* had ordered the army to move faster. *They are hungry*, he had said. *They are far from home. We will meet them at Adwa. We will be ready.*

Now this: reinforcements delayed. Ten days. Tesfaye imagined the Italian camp in Tigray—cold, thin air, the *ferenj* waiting for supplies that would not come. He imagined the Ethiopian host—thousands of *neftegna* (riflemen), cavalry, the *negus* and the *rases* (nobles) and the priests with their *tabots* (holy arks). If Menelik struck before the reinforcements arrived, the balance would tip. If he waited too long, the Italians might dig in, might receive their guns and their food. The telegraph had given Ethiopia something the Italians had not intended: time.

At dawn he met Gebre at the gate. The *fitawrari* was a tall man, a scar across his cheek. He took the paper and did not open it. “*Igeziabher yistilign* (May God have mercy),” he said. “Is it important?” Tesfaye nodded. “Tell the *negus*: they are weak. They are waiting for help that will not come in time. He must strike soon.” Gebre’s eyes narrowed. He slipped the paper into his tunic. “You are sure.” “I am sure. I heard it. They said it in clear. They did not think we were listening.”

Gebre left. Tesfaye walked back to the telegraph hut. The sun was rising over the Entoto hills. Somewhere to the north, the army was moving. Somewhere in Rome, a minister was writing a dispatch that would arrive too late. Tesfaye sat down at the key. His hands were steady. He had done his part. The rest was in the hands of the *negus* and the *rases* and the soldiers who would stand at Adwa.

Three days later, the key chattered again. Panic in the dots and dashes. *D*. *E*. *F*. *E*. *A*. *T*. *A*. *D*. *W*. *A*. *C*. *A*. *S*. *U*. *A*. *L*. *T*. *I*. *E*. *S*. *H*. *I*. *G*. *H*. *R*. *E*. *T*. *R*. *E*. *A*. *T*. Defeat. Adwa. Casualties high. Retreat.

Tesfaye did not smile. He wrote the words. He carried the message to Gebre, who was already surrounded by cheering men—word had come by runner too, the *negus* had won, the Italians were broken. But Tesfaye’s paper was the first proof in writing. The first evidence that the telegraph had carried not only Italian plans but Italian defeat. Gebre took the paper and went to show it to the palace. Tesfaye stood in the compound and listened to the ululating, the drums, the shouts of *Egziabher negus* (God is king). He thought of the small hut, the key, the silent listening. He had not fired a shot. He had not stood in the line at Adwa. But he had given Menelik the gift of time. He had turned the Italians’ own wire against them.

That night he sat at the key again. The line was quiet. The Italians would not send in clear anymore. They would assume they had been betrayed. They would never know by whom. Tesfaye put his hand on the key. He did not send. He only sat in the dark, in the silence, and let the weight of what had happened settle over him. *We won*, he thought. *I helped. No one will write my name in the chronicles. But I know.*

**Historical Note:** The Battle of Adwa (1 March 1896) was a decisive Ethiopian victory over Italian forces and a pivotal moment in the history of colonialism in Africa. Less widely known is the role of communications technology in the lead-up. Ethiopia had acquired a telegraph line that connected the interior to the coast (and thus to Italian-controlled Massawa and to Europe). Italian military and diplomatic traffic often passed over this network. Ethiopian authorities, including Menelik II, had every incentive to intercept or monitor such traffic where they could. Historical evidence suggests that the Ethiopian side had access to intelligence about Italian movements, supply problems, and internal disagreements—though the exact mechanism (telegraph interception, spies, deserters, or runners) is not always clearly documented. The figure of the “Ethiopian telegraph operator” who remained loyal to the emperor and passed Italian traffic to the court is a plausible and compelling way to imagine how such intelligence might have worked. The story highlights the irony that a technology introduced by colonial powers could be turned against them, and that the “invisible” work of operators and interpreters often shaped outcomes as much as the visible work of soldiers. It also underscores Menelik’s pragmatic use of modern tools—weapons, diplomacy, and communications—to defend Ethiopian sovereignty.
