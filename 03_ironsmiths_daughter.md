### The Ironsmith's Daughter

**Time Period / Setting:** The 1920s, in and around Gondar in northwestern Ethiopia. The city carries the memory of the old imperial capital—stone castles, churches, the bustle of the market. Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jewish) communities have lived in the region for centuries, often as craftspeople: potters, weavers, and especially blacksmiths. Their skill is needed; their presence is feared. Many Orthodox Christians believe that *buda* (evil eye)—the power to harm or possess—dwells in blacksmiths and in *Falasha* (the then-common term for Beta Israel). To eat or drink in their presence is dangerous. To cross them is to risk illness or curse. The forge is a place of fire, skill, and isolation.

**Characters:** Almaz—daughter of a Beta Israel blacksmith; her father, Desta; her mother; Getachew—son of a Christian *balabbat* (local notable); the *balabbat* himself; a *debtera* (church scholar/healer); neighbours and market-goers.

The hammer rang against the anvil before dawn. Almaz had heard that sound all her life—the *clang*, the pause, the *clang* again, her father’s breath steady and his arm never tiring. She was not supposed to touch the tools. *Buda* ran in the blood, the Christians said; women who worked iron would double the curse. But her father had no sons. And in the dark, when the compound was asleep, he had taught her. “Your hands are small,” he said. “Small hands are good for the fine work. The *ferenj* will never see what we make. But our people will. The *balabbat* will. They will need ploughs and nails and hinges. They will hate us and they will need us. So you learn. You learn in secret.”

She learned. She learned to read the colour of the metal—when it was ready to bend, when it would break. She learned to temper a blade so it held an edge. She learned to make the small crosses and amulets that even Christians sometimes bought from a distance, when they did not want to admit who had forged them. Her hands grew calloused. Her eyes learned to see in the glow of the coals. She never spoke of it outside the compound. When she went to the market, she lowered her gaze and stepped aside. She was *Falasha*. She was the smith’s daughter. She was used to the whispers: *Buda. Do not eat what she has touched.*

Then Getachew fell ill. He was the *balabbat*’s youngest son—a boy of twelve, fevered and shaking, his belly swollen. The *debtera* came and prayed. He prescribed herbs and holy water. The boy did not improve. Someone said he had eaten *injera* at a house where a *Falasha* had once been. Someone said he had passed the smith’s compound and looked at Desta’s fire. The *balabbat* sent his men to the edge of the Beta Israel quarter. They did not enter. They stood in the road and shouted. “You have put *buda* on our master’s son. You will lift it or we will burn your compound.”

Almaz’s father came out. He was a small man, soot on his face, his arms bare. “I have not touched the boy. I have not seen him. I make iron. I do not make sickness.” The men did not listen. “Lift the curse. Or the *debtera* will come and cut the *buda* out of you.” They meant it. Almaz had heard of such things—of beatings, of compounds driven out of the district. She stood in the doorway of the *tukul* and watched her father’s back. He did not turn to her. He said, “Give me three days. I will bring something to the boy. If he recovers, you leave us in peace. If he does not, do what you will.”

The men left. Her father came inside. His hands were shaking. “I cannot lift *buda*,” he said. “There is no *buda*. The boy is sick with something else—bad water, bad food, I do not know. But they will kill us if we do nothing.” Almaz’s mother was crying. Almaz said, “What will you bring them?” Her father looked at her. “Not me. You. You will make something. A talisman. A cross. Something they will accept as a sign that the curse is broken. They will not know a woman made it. They will not ask. They need to believe. So we give them something to believe in.”

For two days she worked. She made a small iron cross—not the elaborate *meskel* cross of the church, but a simple one, the kind a boy might wear. She tempered it in the way her father had taught her, so it would not rust. She wrapped it in a clean cloth. On the third day her father took it to the *balabbat*’s compound. He did not allow Almaz to go. “If they see you, they will ask questions. Stay.”

He came back at dusk. His face was grey. “The *debtera* blessed the cross. He hung it around the boy’s neck. He said the *buda* would leave. The boy is still fevered. But they have accepted the gift. They said we have one week. If the boy lives, we are left in peace. If he dies, they will say we killed him.”

That night Almaz lay awake. She had made the cross. She had not made the sickness. She did not know if the boy would live. She did not know if it was the water or the food or something no one could see. She only knew that her hands had made something that might become a reason for peace or a reason for blame. *They need us*, her father had said. *They hate us and they need us.* She understood now. The cross was not magic. It was a bridge. It was the only language the *balabbat* and the *debtera* would accept from a *Falasha* smith.

On the fifth day, word came. The boy’s fever had broken. He was weak but alive. The *balabbat* did not come to thank them. But his men did not return. The compound was left in peace. That evening Almaz’s father built the fire and set the anvil in place. He did not speak. He simply handed her the hammer. She took it. She struck the metal. The sound rang out—*clang*, pause, *clang*. Her mother watched from the doorway. No one said *buda*. No one said *Falasha*. They only worked, in the dark, in the firelight, as they had always done.

**Historical Note:** Beta Israel (Ethiopian Jews) have a long history in the Ethiopian highlands, particularly in regions such as Gondar. They were often associated with crafts—especially blacksmithing and pottery—and were both economically necessary and socially marginalised. The term *Falasha* (meaning “exile” or “stranger” in Ge’ez) was commonly used by outsiders; many Beta Israel prefer the name Beta Israel (House of Israel). The belief in *buda*—a harmful power often attributed to blacksmiths and to Beta Israel—is widespread in traditional Ethiopian Orthodox culture. People believed to possess *buda* could “eat” the life force of others, especially through shared food or gaze; blacksmiths were doubly suspect because of their mastery of fire and transformation of metal. This led to strict taboos: Christians might refuse to eat in the presence of smiths or Beta Israel, and accusations of *buda* could trigger violence or expulsion. The story reflects the real tension between dependence on Beta Israel crafts and fear of their perceived spiritual danger, and the ways in which ritual objects (such as blessed crosses) could serve as a medium of negotiation when direct acceptance was impossible. Almaz’s secret apprenticeship echoes the historical reality that Beta Israel women, like men, often worked in crafts, even when convention or stigma demanded that such work be hidden.
