### The Boy Who Never Came Home: Prince Alemayehu

**Time Period / Setting:** 1868–1879, from the ruins of Magdala to Britain. After the fall of the fortress, the British expedition takes Emperor Tewodros’s seven-year-old son, Alemayehu, to India and then to England. Queen Victoria takes a personal interest; he is educated at Rugby and then Sandhurst, but he is never allowed to return to Ethiopia. The story moves through the eyes of someone who loves him—an Ethiopian attendant who is sent back, or a British guardian who must later face the refusal to send his body home. Grey English skies, stiff collars, and a boy who asks for the highland sun.

**Characters:** Alemayehu (Alamayou)—son of Tewodros II, taken to Britain as a child; Captain Tristram Speedy (and/or his wife)—guardian in Britain; an Ethiopian attendant or interpreter who accompanies the prince partway; Queen Victoria (offstage); British officials; the Ethiopian delegation that later pleads for his return and for his body.

The ship left Aden in a haze of coal smoke. On the deck, Alemayehu stood with his hand in Captain Speedy’s. He was seven. He had seen his father’s body. He had seen the *ferenj* (foreigners) take the crown and the manuscripts and the cannons. He had been told he was going to England—*Ingilterra*—where the great queen would care for him. He did not cry. He had cried all the way from Magdala to the coast, and now there was nothing left. Beside him, the man who had served his father—*Ato* (Mister) Welde—knelt so that his eyes were level with the boy’s. “*Lij* (Prince),” Welde said in Amharic, “remember the mountains. Remember the *dabo* (bread). Remember your name. *Alemayehu*—the world has seen him. One day you will go back.” The boy nodded. He did not believe it. Welde was not coming to England. The captain had said so. Only the prince was to go. Welde would be sent back to the coast with a few coins and a letter. *We will civilise him*, the *ferenj* said. *We will make him a gentleman.* Welde pressed his forehead to the boy’s hand. Then he was led away. Alemayehu watched the shore until it was a line, then nothing. The sea was grey. The sky was grey. He had never seen so much grey.

In England there was rain. There were fires in grates and stiff clothes and a woman who was the Queen. She came to see him. She wrote in her diary that he was beautiful, that he was sad. She gave him a guardian: Captain Speedy and his wife, who had been in Abyssinia. They taught him English. They taught him to sit at table and to ride. They sent him to school—first to Cheltenham, then to Rugby. He learned to box. He learned to run. He did not learn to stop dreaming of the highlands. At night he would say the words his mother had said: *Egziabher* (God). *Ityopya* (Ethiopia). *Abba* (Father). He did not say them where the English could hear. They wanted him to become one of them. They did not want him to remember.

When he was eighteen he fell ill. Pleurisy, the doctors said. He was in Leeds. The Speedy family came. He was thin and fevered. He said, in English now, “When I am better, I will ask the Queen again. I will ask to go home. Just once. To see it.” Mrs. Speedy held his hand. She did not tell him that the Queen had already refused—that Ethiopian envoys had come, that they had begged for the prince’s return, and that the answer had been no. *He is too accustomed to England. He would not survive the climate. It is for his own good.* She did not tell him that his mother had died without seeing him, that his country had asked for him again and again. She only said, “Rest. Get well. Then we shall see.” He did not get well. He died on 14 November 1879. The Queen had him buried at Windsor Castle. She wrote that it was a tragedy. She did not send him home.

Years later, when the Ethiopian delegation came again—this time for his body—the answer was the same. *His grave is here. It is a place of honour. We cannot disturb it.* The Ethiopians left with nothing. In the highlands, the priests said *teskar* (memorial) for a prince who had died in a distant land and whose bones would never rest in the soil of *Ityopya*. Welde, if he was still alive, would have been an old man. He would have told the story: the boy on the deck, the grey sea, the hand that had waved once and then dropped. *The world has seen him*, he had said. *One day you will go back.* The world had seen him. He had never gone back. He never would.

**Historical Note:** Prince Alemayehu (Alamayou) was the son of Emperor Tewodros II and Empress Tiruwork Wube. After the fall of Magdala in April 1868 and Tewodros’s suicide, the British expedition took the young prince (aged about seven) to Britain, partly at the urging of Captain Tristram Speedy, who had known Tewodros and became the boy’s guardian. Queen Victoria took a close interest in Alemayehu, supported his education (Cheltenham College, Rugby, and briefly the Royal Military College at Sandhurst), and recorded his visits and his death in her diary. Ethiopian requests for his return during his life were refused on the grounds that he was being educated and “civilised” in Britain. He died of pleurisy in 1879, aged eighteen, and was buried at St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle. Ethiopia has repeatedly requested the repatriation of his remains; the British Crown has declined, citing the sanctity of the grave at Windsor. The story reflects the documented facts of his removal, his upbringing, his death, and the ongoing refusal to return his body—a poignant example of colonial “rescue” and the denial of an Ethiopian prince’s right to rest in his own land.
