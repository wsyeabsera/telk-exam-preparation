### The Heretic's Copy: Zara Yaqob's Inquisition

**Time Period / Setting:** Mid-fifteenth century, in the highlands of Ethiopia. Emperor Zara Yaqob rules from his mountain capital at Debre Berhan; he has consolidated power and faith with an iron hand. Heretics—especially those who reject the emperor’s favoured doctrines or the *Book of the Nativity*—are hunted. Monks who refuse to swear by the emperor’s orthodoxy are imprisoned, mutilated, or killed. Monasteries are searched; books are burned. In a remote *gedam* (monastery) in the north, the air is cold, the *qolo* (roasted grain) is thin, and the scribes work by the light of *cheg* (rush lamps) while rumours of the *negus*’s (king’s) agents spread from valley to valley.

**Characters:** Abba Yohannes—elderly monastic scribe who has hidden a forbidden text; Brother Tekle—younger monk, loyal to the emperor’s orthodoxy; the *aqabe sa’at* (emperor’s representative) and his soldiers; the abbot of the monastery; other monks; the memory of a dead brother who had owned the book.

The knock came at the hour of the night office. Yohannes had been copying a psalter—his hand steady, the *dipuit* (ink) black on the parchment. The sound was not the soft tap of a brother; it was the strike of a fist on wood. He set down his reed and blew out the *cheg*. In the corridor he heard voices—the abbot’s, low and fearful, and another voice he did not know: cold, formal, Ge’ez of the court. *We have come in the name of *negusa nagast* (King of Kings) Zara Yaqob. Every cell will be searched. Every book will be examined. Those that do not conform to the *Metsihaf Berhan* (Book of the Nativity) and the faith of the emperor will be burned. Heretics will be given to the law.*

Yohannes’s heart did not race. He was old. He had known this day might come. Under his sleeping mat lay the thing that would kill him: a copy of the *Metsihaf Genzat* (Book of the Covenant), or a fragment of it—the version that the emperor had condemned, that the *Stefanites* and others had held dear. It had belonged to his brother, a monk who had died in prison years ago, broken by the emperor’s inquisition. Yohannes had hidden it. He had not read it in years. He had told himself he kept it only to remember his brother. But he had also kept it because he could not bear to burn a book. *A book is a soul*, his teacher had said. *You do not burn souls.*

Now the agents were here. If they found it, the monastery would be punished. The abbot would be questioned. Yohannes would be taken to the capital, tried, and likely executed. The book would be burned anyway. *So burn it yourself*, a voice said. *Burn it now. Save the community. Save yourself.* He could do it. The *cheg* was still warm. A single page in the flame and the rest would follow. No one would ever know what had been lost.

He did not move. He thought of his brother—the way he had smiled when he read, the way he had said, *This is not heresy. This is another way to see the *Kidane Mehret* (Covenant of Mercy). The *negus* is afraid of what he does not control.* His brother had been wrong or right; the emperor had not cared. The emperor had wanted one faith, one book, one narrative. Yohannes understood power. He also understood that if every dissenting voice was erased, the only story left would be the emperor’s. And the emperor’s story was written in blood.

Footsteps in the corridor. They were going from cell to cell. He had minutes, perhaps less. He knelt. He drew the book from under the mat. The leather was worn. The pages were thin. He could tear them and feed them to the lamp. He could crumble them and drop them through the floor into the darkness below. He could swallow the key passages. *Fool*, he thought. *You are a fool. Your brother is dead. The book will not bring him back. Burn it.*

He did not burn it. He took the book to the small window that looked onto the cliff. Below was a fissure in the rock—a crack that ran down into the valley, invisible from the path. He had found it as a boy. He had hidden things there before: a letter, a broken cross. He wrapped the book in his *qemis* (tunic), tied it with cord, and lowered it into the fissure. He could not see where it landed. He only knew it was gone from his cell. When the agents opened his door, his hands were empty. His cell held only the psalter, the lamp, and the mat. They searched. They found nothing. The *aqabe sa’at* looked at him with flat eyes. “You have no other books?” “No, *gezé* (lord).” “You swear by the *Metsihaf Berhan* and the faith of the *negus*?” “I swear.” He said it. He had lied. He had also saved something—a voice, a variant, a memory of his brother. He did not know if it would ever be found. He did not know if it would rot in the rock or if one day someone would climb down and hold it in the light. He only knew that he had chosen not to burn it. That night, when the agents were gone and the monastery lay in silence, he prayed for forgiveness. He also prayed that the book would survive. *Let something remain*, he thought. *Let something remain that is not the *negus*’s alone.*

**Historical Note:** Zara Yaqob (r. 1434–1468) was one of Ethiopia’s most powerful and doctrinally assertive emperors. He promoted the *Metsihaf Berhan* (Book of the Nativity) as a test of orthodoxy and persecuted those who disagreed—including monks and movements such as the Stefanites, who held different views on the Sabbath, Christology, or the authority of the emperor in religious matters. His reign saw executions, mutilations, and the destruction of books deemed heretical. The *Metsihaf Genzat* (Book of the Covenant) and related texts represented alternative theological traditions; copies were hunted and burned. Monasteries were searched by imperial agents (*aqabe sa’at* and others), and scribes who preserved forbidden texts risked death. The story reflects the real tension between imperial orthodoxy and the monastic tradition of preserving and copying texts—including those that fell out of favour. Hiding books in caves, walls, or remote locations is a documented way that Ethiopian monks have preserved manuscripts through periods of persecution. The narrative does not endorse any particular doctrine; it highlights the human choice to preserve or destroy written memory, and the cost of that choice under a ruler who demanded a single, controlled faith.
