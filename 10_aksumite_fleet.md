### The Last Voyage of the Aksumite Fleet

**Time Period / Setting:** Sixth century CE, in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. The kingdom of Aksum is at the height of its power: it controls trade in ivory, incense, and gold; it has conquered Himyar (in today’s Yemen) and intervened in Arabian politics; its ships sail to the coast of India and perhaps beyond. But the grip on the other shore is fragile. Revolts, plague, and the rising power of Persia and Byzantium will soon reshape the region. This is the story of a voyage—and of the moment when a captain or a merchant hears that the world behind him is changing.

**Characters:** Wa’zeb—Aksumite captain or *nagad* (merchant) in charge of a ship; his crew (sailors, rowers, guards); the *negus* (king) of Aksum and his court (offstage); the *kaleb* (king) of Himyar or his rivals (offstage); traders and port officials in a distant harbour; the sea, the wind, and the news that travels slower than the ship.

The ship had left Adulis in the dry season. The harbour was thick with the smell of salt and timber and the *libanos* (frankincense) that lay in the hold. Wa’zeb had made this run a dozen times—down the Red Sea, past the straits, into the great water that led to *Hind* (India). He carried ivory and tortoiseshell and gold. He would bring back pepper and cloth and the stories of the eastern ports. The *negus* (king) in Aksum demanded tribute and trade. The *negus* in Himyar—the land across the water, where Aksumite armies had gone to punish the Jews and restore the Christians—demanded loyalty and taxes. Wa’zeb did not think of himself as a conqueror. He was a *nagad* (merchant). He had learned the currents. He had learned to read the stars. He had learned that the sea did not care who ruled the shore. It only cared that you respected it.

The voyage out had been long. They had touched at ports where the people spoke languages Wa’zeb did not know. They had traded. They had heard rumours. *The king in Himyar is dead. The Persians are coming. The *negus* in Aksum has sent more soldiers. The plague has reached the coast.* Wa’zeb had listened. He had not known what to believe. News at sea was always late and always twisted. He had filled his hold. He had turned the ship toward home.

The storm had caught them three days from the straits. The wind had torn the sail. The crew had bailed and prayed. Wa’zeb had stood at the stern and shouted orders. He had thought of his wife in Adulis. He had thought of the *negus*’s tax. He had thought, *If we sink, none of it matters.* They had not sunk. The wind had dropped. The sea had gone calm. They had limped into a harbour on the Arabian coast—a place where Aksumite ships had once been welcome. But when they landed, the mood was wrong. The men in the port did not meet his eyes. The official who came to inspect the cargo spoke in a low voice. “You have been at sea a long time.” “Months.” “Then you have not heard. Himyar has risen. Our soldiers are driven out. The *negus*’s governor is dead. The Persians have sent ships. Aksum still holds the African shore. But the other shore—” He had spread his hands. “The other shore is lost.”

Wa’zeb had stood in the heat. The sun had burned his neck. He had thought of the soldiers who had crossed the sea years ago—the campaign that had put a Christian king in Himyar, that had made the Red Sea an Aksumite lake. He had thought of the ivory in his hold, the pepper he had not yet bought, the road home. *If the other shore is lost*, he thought, *then the sea is no longer ours. Then every voyage is a risk. Then the world has changed and we did not feel it until now.*

He had paid the port fees. He had taken on water. He had set sail for Adulis. He did not know what he would tell the *negus*. He would tell him the news. He would tell him that the ship had survived. He would tell him that the trade could continue—but not as before. Nothing would be as before. The empire had stretched across the water. Now it was shrinking back. He stood at the prow and watched the horizon. The sea was blue and endless. It had carried Aksum’s ships for generations. It would carry them still—but the ports would be fewer. The safety would be less. The age when Aksum could claim both shores was ending. He had seen it in the official’s eyes. He had heard it in the silence of the port. He was not a prophet. He was a captain. He would deliver his cargo. He would deliver the news. The rest was for the *negus* and the years to come.

**Historical Note:** The kingdom of Aksum (roughly first to late first millennium CE) was a major power in the Horn of Africa and the Red Sea. It controlled the port of Adulis, traded in ivory, incense, gold, and other goods, and sent ships across the Red Sea and into the Indian Ocean. In the sixth century, Aksum intervened in Himyar (Yemen), conquering it and installing a Christian ruler; Aksumite presence there was real but eventually contested by local revolt and by Persian and Byzantine interests. The period saw both the high point of Aksumite naval and commercial reach and the beginning of its contraction. The story draws on the documented reality of Aksumite seafaring, the importance of Adulis and the Red Sea trade, and the fragility of cross-sea empire—news travelled slowly, and a captain might only learn of the loss of distant territory when he put into port. The narrative does not hinge on a single historical battle or date but on the broader moment when an empire that had stretched across the water began to pull back, as seen through the eyes of someone whose livelihood and identity were tied to the sea.
