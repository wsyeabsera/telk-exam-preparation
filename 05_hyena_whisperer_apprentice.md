### The Hyena Whisperer's Apprentice

**Time Period / Setting:** The 1990s, in and around the historic walled city of Harar in eastern Ethiopia. Harar is known as the “City of Saints” and is a centre of Islam and Oromo culture. For generations, a few men have gone outside the walls at dusk to feed wild spotted hyenas—by hand, and sometimes by mouth—from a basket of meat and *injera*. The practice is said to protect the city and to maintain a pact between humans and hyenas. To outsiders it is spectacle; to the *hyena men* it is *baraka* (blessing), tradition, and risk. The night is dark beyond the walls. The hyenas’ eyes glow. The air smells of dust, meat, and fear.

**Characters:** Hassen—a teenage boy from Harar; Yusuf—the ageing *hyena man* who takes him as apprentice; Hassen’s mother and uncle; the hyenas (especially one that will break the pattern); townspeople and the few tourists who come to watch.

The first time Hassen went out with Yusuf, he vomited. Not from the smell of the meat—though the smell was strong, blood and bone and the *injera* Yusuf mixed in the basket—but from the eyes. The hyenas came from the dark beyond the wall, their shoulders rolling, their breath loud. Yusuf sat on a rock with the basket between his knees and called them. He had a name for each, he said. The big one with the torn ear was *Abba* (Father). The skinny one that hung back was *Dhebeya* (Wolf). They came. They took the meat from his hand. Once, Yusuf put a piece between his teeth and leaned forward. A hyena took it from his mouth. Hassen’s stomach turned. He wanted to run. But Yusuf had said, *If you run, they read fear. They do not attack. But they remember. They will not trust you again.*

So Hassen stood. He did not run. He watched. When it was over and the hyenas had melted back into the dark, Yusuf said, “*Alhamdulillah* (Praise God). You did not move. That is the first lesson. The second is: they are not pets. They are not tame. They come because we have fed them for years. Because our fathers fed them. Because the city has a pact with them. We feed them; they do not enter the walls. We respect them; they do not take our children. That is the *baraka*. You break the pact, they break the pact. You understand?” Hassen nodded. He did not understand yet. But he wanted to. He wanted to be the one who sat on the rock and called the dark by name.

For months he went with Yusuf. He learned to hold the meat steady. He learned to read the hyenas’ moods—the flattening of ears, the stiffening of the back. He learned that the old ones had hierarchy, that the young ones had to wait. He learned to sit still when a hyena sniffed his hand, when its breath was hot on his wrist. His mother did not like it. “It is not a job,” she said. “It is a curse. The *ferenj* take pictures. They think we are crazy. The hyenas will bite you one day.” His uncle said, “Let him learn. Yusuf is old. Someone must hold the *baraka*. Better our boy than a stranger.” Hassen did not care about the *ferenj*. He cared about the moment when the hyenas came out of the dark and the world became simple: hand, meat, trust.

Then came the night of the new one. Yusuf saw it first. “*Hara* (Look). That one. I do not know him.” A hyena stood at the edge of the circle—larger than the others, its coat patchy, its head low. It did not take the meat from Yusuf’s hand. It snapped. It lunged at *Abba*, who backed away. Yusuf’s voice went hard. “*Yihun* (Sick). Or *wedeb* (mad). Do not feed that one. Do not look in its eyes.” He threw meat away from the circle. The new hyena went for it. The others ate from Yusuf’s hand. But the new one kept circling. Its eyes were wrong. Hassen had learned to read eyes. These were not the eyes of an animal that wanted food. These were the eyes of something that had forgotten the pact.

“We go,” Yusuf said. “Now. Slowly.” They gathered the basket. They stood. The hyenas that knew them stepped back. The new one did not. It came forward. It bared its teeth. Hassen’s heart hammered. *Do not run. If you run, they read fear.* But this one was not reading. This one was not part of the pact. Yusuf said, “*Bismillah* (In the name of God). Give me the basket.” Hassen handed it. Yusuf threw the rest of the meat in a wide arc—away from them, into the dark. The hyenas scattered after it. The new one hesitated. Then it turned and went for the meat. Yusuf took Hassen’s arm. “Walk. Do not look back.” They walked. The wall of Harar rose in front of them. The gate was open. They passed through. Only then did Hassen allow himself to breathe.

The next night Yusuf did not go out. “That one will come again,” he said. “Until it is gone—sick dead or driven away—we do not feed. The pact is with the ones who remember. Not with the *wedeb*.” For a week they did not go. The hyenas came to the usual place and waited. They did not enter the city. But the people said the nights felt wrong. The *baraka* was broken. Then word came: a hyena had been found dead on the road—patchy coat, the one that had snapped. Maybe sickness. Maybe a car. Yusuf went out again. The old ones came. They ate from his hand. *Abba* came. *Dhebeya* came. The pact held.

That night Yusuf let Hassen feed them. Not from his mouth—not yet. But from his hand. The meat was cold and wet. The hyena’s lips touched his fingers. Its eyes were calm. Hassen did not vomit. He did not run. He fed *Abba* and *Dhebeya* and the others. When the basket was empty, Yusuf said, “*Alhamdulillah*. You are ready. One day you will sit on the rock alone. You will call them. They will come. And the city will sleep because you held the *baraka*.” Hassen looked at the dark beyond the wall. He thought of the *wedeb* hyena—the one that had forgotten. He thought of the pact. He nodded. “*Inshallah* (God willing),” he said. “I will hold it.”

**Historical Note:** Harar is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of Islam’s holiest cities, with a distinct culture and its own language (Harari). The practice of feeding wild hyenas at the outskirts of the city—often by hand and sometimes by placing food in the feeder’s mouth for the hyena to take—has been documented for decades and continues today. The men who do this are sometimes called “hyena men” (*yebareya sew* or similar local terms); they are few in number and the role is often passed within families or to chosen apprentices. Explanations for the tradition vary: protection of the city from hyena attacks, fulfilment of a historical pact, spiritual or Sufi-influenced *baraka*, and more recently, a draw for tourists. The hyenas are wild; bites and close calls do occur, and the relationship depends on habituation and routine rather than domestication. The story’s “rabid” or sick hyena represents a real risk—disease or injury can make habituated animals unpredictable and force feeders to suspend the ritual until the threat passes. The narrative captures the tension between tradition and danger, the weight of apprenticeship, and the way Harar’s identity is bound up with this unique human–hyena relationship.
