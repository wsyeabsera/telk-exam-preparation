### The Emperor Who Was Erased: Lij Iyasu

**Time Period / Setting:** 1913–1916, in the Ethiopian highlands—Addis Ababa, Harar, and the shifting centres of power. Lij Iyasu, grandson of Menelik II, has been designated heir and effectively rules after Menelik’s death. He is young, restless, and drawn to Islam and to the Ottomans; he favours Harar and Somali and Oromo allies and alarms the northern nobility and the Church. In 1916 the *rases* (nobles) and the *abun* (Patriarch) declare him deposed for apostasy and install Empress Zewditu with Ras Tafari (the future Haile Selassie) as regent. Iyasu becomes a non-person: his name is struck from chronicles, his image destroyed. Those who had served him must choose silence or ruin.

**Characters:** Gebre—courtier and scribe who had served Lij Iyasu; the young emperor (Iyasu) himself; Ras Tafari and the nobles who lead the coup; the *abun*; other courtiers and soldiers; the new regime’s chroniclers who will rewrite the past.

Gebre had first seen Lij Iyasu in the *gibbi* (palace compound) at the coronation of Empress Zewditu—except there was no coronation for Iyasu anymore. There was only the announcement, read in the square: *Lij Iyasu has abandoned the faith of his fathers. He has consorted with Muslims. He has been deposed. The *negusa nagast* (King of Kings) is no more. Empress Zewditu is crowned. Ras Tafari is regent.* The crowd had murmured. Some had cheered. Gebre had stood at the edge and felt the world tilt. He had served Iyasu. He had carried his messages. He had written his letters. He had believed—or had forced himself to believe—that the young *negus* would grow into the role. That his fascination with Harar and with the Ottomans was only curiosity. That his refusal to be crowned in the Orthodox rite was delay, not apostasy. Now the *rases* had spoken. The *abun* had spoken. Iyasu was not merely deposed. He was *erased*.

In the chancery, the order came within the week. *Remove his name from all documents. Destroy his seal. Burn any proclamation that bears his title. From this day he is not *negus*. He is not *lij*. He is nothing.* Gebre had stood with the other scribes. He had taken the papers they gave him. He had watched the fire consume the words *Lij Iyasu*, *negusa nagast*, *Ityopya*. He had thought, *I wrote those. I wrote his name. Now I am burning the proof that he ever ruled.* His hand did not shake. If it had shaken, someone would have noticed. Someone would have asked, *Were you loyal to him? Do you mourn?* To mourn was dangerous. To question the new order was treason. So he burned. He erased. He became a man who had never served an emperor who had never been.

He heard rumours. Iyasu had fled. He was in the desert. He was in Harar. He was raising an army. He was broken. He was dead. Gebre did not seek the truth. The truth did not matter. What mattered was that the chronicles would be rewritten. The new scribes would write of Zewditu and Ras Tafari. They would write of Iyasu only as a footnote of shame—*the one who apostatised, the one who was removed*. They would not write that he had been young. That he had been curious. That he had tried to reach beyond the highland Christian elite to the Muslims and the Oromo and the Somali. That the *rases* had feared exactly that. Gebre could not write it either. He could only remember. In the silence of his house, at night, he would say the name once. *Iyasu.* Then he would say nothing. He would pick up his pen and copy the new proclamations. *Zewditu*, *negeste negest* (Queen of Kings). *Ras Tafari*, *tegle* (regent). The past was ash. The future was theirs. He had survived by becoming a man who had no past. He had survived by forgetting the boy he had served—the boy who had laughed, who had asked questions, who had wanted to see Harar and the sea. That boy was gone. The chronicles would not hold him. Only Gebre’s memory would, and he would never speak it aloud.

Years later, when Iyasu was finally captured and imprisoned—when the last rebellion in his name had failed—Gebre heard the news in the market. He did not react. He went home. He sat in the dark. He thought, *They will never free him. They will never crown him. They will never give him back his name in the books. But I remember. I remember that he was.* It was not enough. It was all he had. The emperor who had been erased had taken with him the loyalty of those who had served him—into silence, into fear, into the small space of memory that no regime could burn.

**Historical Note:** Lij Iyasu (c. 1895–1935) was the designated successor of Menelik II and effectively ruled Ethiopia from Menelik’s death in 1913 until his deposition in 1916. He never underwent a formal Orthodox coronation. He showed strong interest in Islam, spent time in Harar, allied with Ottoman and Muslim notables, and favoured Oromo and Somali leaders, which alienated the northern Ethiopian nobility and the Orthodox Church. In September 1916, the nobility and the Patriarch declared him deposed on grounds of apostasy and installed Menelik’s daughter Zewditu as empress, with Ras Tafari (later Emperor Haile Selassie) as regent. Iyasu fled and was eventually captured; he remained in captivity until his death. His reign was systematically erased from official memory: his name was removed from documents, his image destroyed, and chronicles were rewritten to present the transition as legitimate and necessary. The story reflects the real historical process of deposing a ruler and then eliminating him from the official record—and the human cost for those who had served him and had to adapt or hide their loyalty to survive under the new order.
