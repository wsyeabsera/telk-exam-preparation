### The Last Letter from Magdala

**Time Period / Setting:** April 1868, the fortress of Magdala in the Ethiopian highlands. Emperor Tewodros II has retreated to this mountain stronghold with his court, his prisoners, and his dreams of a unified empire. British expeditionary forces under Robert Napier have crossed the highlands; their cannons have begun to speak. The air tastes of smoke and fear. Inside the palace, scribes work by lamplight while the world outside cracks apart.

**Characters:** Yohannes—young scribe in the royal *chancery* (secretariat); Emperor Tewodros II (Kassa)—the embattled king; Abuna Salama—Coptic Patriarch; court officials and soldiers; the British captives held in the fortress.

The first boom came at dawn. Yohannes felt it in his chest before he heard it—a deep *thud* that shook the ink pot on his desk and sent a single drop rolling across the letter he had been copying. He set down his reed pen and looked at the small window. The sky over the escarpment was grey; the smell of gunpowder had already crept into the room, thin and bitter.

*They are here*, he thought. *The *ferenj* (foreigners) have brought their *top* (cannon) to the mountain.*

He had known this day would come. For weeks the *asir* (messengers) had brought word: Napier’s army climbing the passes, the *balabbat* (local chiefs) melting away, the roads to Magdala crowded with refugees and deserters. The emperor had ordered the royal correspondence gathered. Some documents were to be copied and sent to the monasteries for safekeeping; others were to be burned so that no *ferenj* hand would ever touch them. Yohannes did not know which category the letter in front of him belonged to. It was a plea from Tewodros to Queen Victoria—written in Ge’ez, then translated into English by one of the captive missionaries—asking for friendship and for craftsmen to help build his realm. The emperor had once believed that letter would change everything. Now he did not leave his chambers, and the scribes worked in a silence that felt like waiting for a verdict.

A footstep in the corridor. Yohannes turned. It was Gebre, the senior scribe, his face the colour of ash. “*Egziabher yistilign* (May God have mercy),” Gebre said. “He wants to see you. In the throne room.”

Yohannes’s stomach tightened. To be summoned by the *negusa nagast* (King of Kings) in such an hour could mean honour or death. He had seen Tewodros only from a distance—a heavy figure in a dark *shamma* (wrap), his eyes burning. The emperor had once been the hope of the highlands, the man who would end the *Zemene Mesafint* (Era of the Princes) and restore order. Now he was a man who had lost his allies, his patience, and perhaps his mind. He had ordered the British captives chained. He had had rebels executed in front of the walls. He had also, the scribes whispered, begun to burn his own treasures rather than let them fall to the enemy.

The throne room was cold. A single brazier threw shadows on the walls. Tewodros sat not on the throne but on a low stool, a rifle across his knees. His beard was unkempt; his *shamma* was stained. When he spoke, his voice was low and cracked.

“You are the one who writes the letters.”

“*Igeziabiher* (Yes, my lord).” Yohannes bowed.

“The letters to the *ferenj*. The letters to the *abun* (Patriarch). The letters to the rebels.” Tewodros lifted his head. “Do you believe they will be read? Do you believe anyone will remember what I tried to do?”

Yohannes did not know how to answer. *They will remember the siege*, he thought. *They will remember the cannons. They will not remember the words.*

“I want one more letter,” Tewodros said. “Not to the Queen. Not to Napier. To the *abun* Salama. Tell him …” He paused. Somewhere beyond the walls, another cannon spoke. “Tell him I did not betray the faith. Tell him I sought to strengthen this kingdom. Tell him that when the *ferenj* write their history, they will call me a tyrant. But the *abun* knew me. He knew what I wanted. Write that. Then take the letter to him yourself. And after that—” He looked at the small heap of papers and bound manuscripts in the corner. “After that, burn the rest. Everything the *ferenj* must not see. Do you understand?”

Yohannes understood. He understood that the emperor was preparing for the end. He understood that he was being asked to decide what would survive and what would turn to ash. He nodded.

He wrote through the afternoon. The letter to Abuna Salama took shape slowly—formal Ge’ez, the script precise, the sentences weighted with the emperor’s defiance and his sorrow. When he was done, he folded it and sealed it with the royal seal that Gebre had given him. Then he went to the room where the rest of the correspondence lay.

There were treaties and petitions, letters from European monarchs, maps, chronicles of the court. There were also the emperor’s private notes—ravings and visions, lists of grievances, prayers. Yohannes had copied many of them. He had held the originals in his hands. *If I burn them*, he thought, *no one will ever know what he really believed. If I save them, the *ferenj* will take them and put them in a museum and tell our story for us.*

His hands were shaking. He had never had to choose before. He had only ever written what he was told to write.

In the corridor he heard shouting—soldiers running, an order in Amharic. *Hold the gate. Hold the gate.* The cannons had not stopped. He could smell smoke now, not just gunpowder but the smoke of fires—perhaps the *ferenj* were shelling the town below. He thought of the monks in the monasteries, the books they had already hidden in caves and *tabots* (holy arks). He thought of the emperor’s face. *Tell him I did not betray the faith.*

Yohannes took the letter for the *abun* and slipped it inside his *shamma*. Then he began to feed the rest of the papers to the brazier. The flames leapt; the parchment curled and blackened. He did not look away. He watched the words disappear—the treaties, the maps, the emperor’s private rage. When the last page was ash, he stood in the dim room, the heat on his face, and knew that he had made a choice that would haunt him for the rest of his life. He had saved one letter. He had destroyed a thousand. He would never know if it was the right thing to do.

He delivered the letter to Abuna Salama that evening. The *abun* was an old man, thin and tired. He took the letter and did not open it. He said, “*Egziabher yihune le’Egziabher* (God give you what is God’s). Go. If the fortress falls, do not stay. Save yourself.”

The next morning Magdala fell. Tewodros took his own life rather than be captured. The British looted the fortress—manuscripts, crowns, crosses. Yohannes fled with the refugees down the mountain. He never saw the *abun* again. He never knew if the letter was read or hidden or lost. But in the years that followed, when he told the story to his children, he always said: *I wrote the last letter. I burned the rest. I do not know if I was right. I only know that I was there.*

**Historical Note:** The siege and fall of Magdala (April 1868) are well documented: Emperor Tewodros II, who had imprisoned British envoys and missionaries, faced a punitive expedition under Robert Napier. After bombardment and assault, Tewodros committed suicide and the British plundered the fortress, taking away hundreds of manuscripts and religious objects—many of which remain in British institutions today. Less known is the role of Ethiopian scribes and court officials in the final days: the deliberate destruction of documents to prevent their capture, and the desperate effort to preserve a narrative of Tewodros’s reign for the Church and for posterity. The story reflects the reality that imperial archives were selectively copied, hidden, or burned in times of invasion, and that scribes like Yohannes carried both the burden and the ambiguity of deciding what would survive. It also underscores Tewodros’s complex legacy—at once modernizer and tyrant—and the fragility of written memory in a moment of military and political collapse.
