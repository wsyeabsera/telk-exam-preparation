### The Hidden Rock Churches of Lalibela's Women

**Time Period / Setting:** Late 12th to early 13th century, the highlands of Lasta in what is now Amhara region. King Lalibela has vowed to carve a New Jerusalem from living rock—a place of pilgrimage when the route to the Holy Land was cut by war. Dust hangs in the mountain air; the sound of chisels echoes in the gullies.

**Characters / People Involved:** King Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (the Zagwe ruler who gave the town its name); unnamed female stone-workers and carriers who appear in local oral tradition; the *waqabi* (craft masters) who directed the carving; priests who later wrote the chronicles that omitted the women.

**Story:** The chronicles say angels carved the churches by night. The priests wrote of the king’s vision and the *waqabi* who drew the plans. No scribe wrote the names of the women who carried water and crushed stone, who held the ropes for the men dangling over the cliffs, or who, in some tellings, took up the chisel themselves when hands were few.

In the high villages around Roha—the name of the place before it became Lalibela—grandmothers still tell it differently. One story says a woman named *Tigist* (patience) was the first to suggest carving from the top down, so the rain would not pool inside. Another says the *bale-wuqabi* (female craft-keepers) mixed the lime and crushed volcanic stone that sealed the joints, and that their daughters learned to read the grain of the rock so that no crack would split a pillar. The churches were not built; they were *uncovered*, *yemigebaw*—released from the mountain. That work needed more than strong arms; it needed eyes that could see the church inside the stone. Some of those eyes, the old women say, belonged to their foremothers.

When the sun set, the workers climbed back to the *tukul* (round thatched huts) on the slopes. Their hands were raw, their backs bent. They had no titles in the royal chronicles. But in the walls of Biete Giyorgis—the Church of St. George, shaped like a cross—the stone holds the memory of every blow. The angels worked by night, the priests said. The women had worked by day.

**Why it's Fascinating / Reflection:** Official Ethiopian Orthodox chronicles attribute the carving of Lalibela’s churches to King Lalibela and divine or angelic help, and rarely name the labourers. Oral tradition in the area, however, often credits women with carrying, crushing, mixing, and sometimes carving—roles that would have been essential in any large-scale rock-cut project. The story matters because it restores a human, and specifically female, layer to one of the world’s great architectural wonders. It also reflects a broader pattern: highland Ethiopian society has long relied on women’s labour in construction and craft, even when written history has tended to record only rulers and clergy. Lalibela’s churches are a monument to faith and kingship, but they are also, in local memory, a monument to unnamed hands—many of them women’s.
