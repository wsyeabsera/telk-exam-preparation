# Backlog

Ideas captured for later; not on the main roadmap.

- **Accessibility** – Improve keyboard/screen reader support, focus management.
- **i18n** – UI labels in German for learners who prefer German interface.
- **Analytics** – Weak areas by tag/focus from attempt history (e.g. “You often miss Dativ”).
- **Offline** – Service worker for full offline use if needed.
